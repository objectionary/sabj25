This repository contains a set of benchmarks for [Stream API] in Java 25.

The motivation of this repository is the lack of benchmarks that would
  cover the entire set of terminal and non-terminal methods of
  Java Stream API, in their different combinations.
The benchmarks of [Biboudis et al.][biboudis2014] ([sources][cotl])
  and [Møller et al.][moller2020] ([sources][streamliner])
  only cover `map()` and `filter()` methods.
[Rosales et al.][rosales2023] go further with `StreamProf`, the first
  dedicated stream profiler for the JVM, yet they target the runtime
  overhead of `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` rather than the
  breadth of the API.

A few open-source projects on GitHub benchmark streams as well,
  yet each of them stays narrow:
  [keaz/java-stream-benchmark][keaz] measures only `sort()` and
  `toString()` to tell when a parallel stream pays off,
  [Pask423/stream-benchmarks][pask423] studies the internals of
  parallel streams across a range of thread counts,
  [phonty29/stream-benchmarks][phonty29] compares streams against
  ordinary `for` loops,
  and [Nikolas-Charalambidis/java-16-mapmulti-benchmark][mapmulti]
  contrasts the `mapMulti()` method with `flatMap()`.
The [SoftwareMill][softwaremill] blog benchmarks a single
  log-processing pipeline of `map()`, `filter()`, and
  `collect(groupingBy())`, again touching only a handful of methods.
None of them exercise the full set of terminal and intermediate
  methods, let alone their combinations.

## Principles

The pipelines are built to measure the Stream API itself, not the
  cleverness of a particular JIT compiler. They follow a few rules:

- **No incidental repetition.** Where a pipeline sets out to cover the
  API, each method appears exactly once, so it measures the operation in
  combination with others rather than a loop of the same call.
  Repetition shows up only when it is the subject itself, as in the
  chain inside `stateless` that repeats `map()` and `filter()` on
  purpose to turn the call sites megamorphic.
- **No easy optimization hotspots.** A `Blackhole` observation sits
  after each boxing stage, because otherwise GraalVM's partial escape
  analysis scalar-replaces the boxed `Long` and `Double` values and the
  whole pipeline collapses to almost nothing, measuring elision instead
  of work.
- **Lambdas do real arithmetic.** No lambda is an identity function;
  every element flows through genuine computation at each step.
- **Every result is verified.** Each pipeline checks its result against a
  precomputed constant, so a run that silently skipped work fails loudly
  rather than reporting a fast but wrong number.
  Order-insensitive pipelines fold into a plain sum, while pipelines
  whose contract includes encounter order, such as `sorted()`,
  `limit()`, and `forEachOrdered()`, fold through a rolling `31`-based
  mix, so a result that holds the right elements in the wrong order
  fails too.
- **The full API, in combination.** The pipelines span all four stream
  types, `long`, `int`, `double`, and object, and weave terminal and
  intermediate methods together, including `flatMap()` and `mapMulti()`.
- **One facet of the API per benchmark.** `stateless` covers the
  stateless operations including the one-to-one scalar conversions,
  `stateful` the operations that must remember state, `fold` the
  reduction terminals, `ordered` the short-circuiting ones, and so on
  through gatherers, collectors, sources, and parallel execution.

## Results

The numbers come from [JMH][jmh] 1.37, the Java Microbenchmark Harness,
  driven from a JUnit test that builds the `Options` and runs the `Runner`
  programmatically rather than from the command line.
Every method is measured in `AverageTime` mode and reported in
  milliseconds per operation (`ms/op`), so each score is the mean wall-clock
  time of a single invocation of one `@Benchmark` method.
Because each pipeline processes a different element count and operation mix,
  the rows measure distinct workloads: compare JVMs down a single column,
  not one benchmark against another across rows.
Each benchmark runs in two forks (each a freshly started JVM), with three
  warmup iterations of one second each to let the JIT compiler settle,
  followed by five measurement iterations of two seconds each; the reported
  score is the arithmetic mean of all ten measurement iterations across the
  two forks.
The state is thread-scoped and JMH drives each benchmark from a single
  measurement thread, though the pipelines that call `parallel()` still fan
  their work across the shared fork-join pool; a `Blackhole` consumes
  intermediate boxed values to stop the JIT from eliminating the pipeline
  as dead code.
JMH writes the raw results to `target/jmh-result.csv`, which the CI
  pipeline parses into the table below.
The benchmarks run on every push to `master`, once per JVM, and the
  table is regenerated automatically:

All scores are in milliseconds per operation (ms/op); lower is better.
The results were calculated in [this GHA job][benchmark-gha]
on 2026-06-12 at 07:38.
Each JVM ran on its own GitHub-hosted Linux runner,
so the scores across columns are indicative, not strictly comparable.
